## Large Language Model

A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like text. These models are capable of understanding and generating natural language, making them useful for various tasks such as text completion, language translation, and text generation. Large language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing and have been used in a wide range of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation.
